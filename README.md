Blog post about how to get started doing performance testing using [The Grinder](http://grinder.sourceforge.net/).

Based on [workshops](https://github.com/kvalle/grinder-workshop) held at [ROOTS](http://www.rootsconf.no/talks/42) and [FreeTest](http://free-test.org/node/81#2012051009-EspenHalvorsen), se present several examples ranging from simply measuring HTTP GET response times, to validating the responses from different pages, to how to test against REST APIs.

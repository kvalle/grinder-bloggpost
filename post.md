# Getting Started With The Grinder

Performance testing is important. 
In this blog post we will explain why, introduce you to The Grinder, and take you through five examples which will get you started using Grinder to test the performance of your web application.

The post is based on workshops held at [ROOTS](http://www.rootsconf.no/talks/42) and [FreeTest](http://free-test.org/node/81#2012051009-EspenHalvorsen).
The materials from these--slides, tasks and code--are [available on GitHub](https://github.com/kvalle/grinder-workshop).
To get the most out of the examples, you may want to follow along with the workshop trying each task on you own, before we present the solutions here.
